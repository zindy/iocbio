We are proud to release a new package for deconvolving 3D microscope images iocbio.microscope. It is a part of an open-source software project iocbio from the Laboratory of Systems Biology in the Institute of Cybernetics at Tallinn Technical University (http://sysbio.ioc.ee).

Iocbio.microscope software package allows to deconvolve microscope images. In addition to the deconvolution program, the package includes the set of tools that is required for processing images, estimation of point spread function (PSF) and visualizing the results. This software is written in Python and is released with an open-source license (BSD).

Iocbio is developed under Linux (ubuntu) but will also run under Windows
(we provide installer for Windows users to ease the process of setting
up the iocbio software as well as its prerequisites).

Mathematical background of implemented deconvolution algorithm, notes and guidelines on selection of parameters for deconvolution and application to real-life images are described in a recent paper
