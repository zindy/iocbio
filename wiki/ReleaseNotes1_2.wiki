#summary Release notes for 1.2 version.

We are proud to present a new Python package:

  iocbio.microscope - a Python package for deconvolving 3D microscope images

that is part of an open-source software iocbio from the Laboratory of Systems Biology.

Iocbio.microscope software package allows to deconvolve microscope images. In addition to the deconvolution program, the package includes of the set of tools that are required for processing the images, estimation of point spread function (PSF) and visualizing the results. This software is written in Python and is released with an open-source license (see below).
